## üß≠ User Journey: Step by Step

### üìù How Free Text Preferences Are Understood

Just describe your travel tastes and dreams in your own words‚ÄîTasteTrip‚Äôs AI will understand and extract all your preferences for you. Here‚Äôs how it works:

- **AI Parsing:**
  - Together AI receives your description and is prompted to extract specific details about your music, movie, food, and travel vibe.
  - The AI is asked to return only valid JSON containing:
    - `music`: artist, genre, or style
    - `movie`: movie, director, or genre
    - `food`: cuisine or food type
    - `vibe`: travel mood (relaxing, adventurous, romantic, party, cultural, luxury, nature, historical)

**Prompt Example:**
```
Extract travel preferences from this description: "I love jazz and Italian food"

Be specific and extract actual names/types. Return ONLY valid JSON:
{
    "music": "specific artist, genre, or music style mentioned",
    "movie": "specific movie, director, or film genre mentioned", 
    "food": "specific cuisine type or food preference mentioned",
    "vibe": "travel mood: relaxing, adventurous, romantic, party, cultural, luxury, nature, historical"
}
```

### 1. User Input Processing
**Route**: `/itinerary` (POST)

**Input Types**:
- **Structured**: Direct form inputs (music, movies, food preferences)
- **Text Description**: Free-form text parsed by AI

**Text Parsing Logic**:
```python
# Uses Together AI (Mistral-7B) to extract structured data
prompt = "Extract travel preferences from: '{description}'"
# Returns: {"music": "jazz", "movie": "godfather", "food": "italian", "vibe": "cultural"}
```

**Date Processing**:
- Calculates activity days: `total_days - 2` (excludes travel days)
- Minimum 1 day, maximum based on date range

### 2. Taste-Based City Recommendation
**Module**: `geodb_api.py`

**Process**:
1. **Qloo API Call**: Sends user preferences to Qloo Taste AI
2. **Cultural Mapping**: Creates taste-to-destination connections
3. **City Selection**: Returns recommended city with reasoning
4. **Venue Discovery**: Finds taste-aligned venues in the city

**Output Structure**:
```python
{
    "city": "Barcelona",
    "reason": "Perfect match for your jazz and art preferences...",
    "venues": ["Palau de la M√∫sica", "Picasso Museum"],
    "taste_mapping": [
        {
            "category": "üéµ Music",
            "preference": "Jazz",
            "cultural_path": "Barcelona's vibrant jazz scene...",
            "experience": "Live performances at historic venues"
        }
    ]
}
```

### 3. AI Itinerary Generation
**Module**: `itinerary.py`

**Multi-AI Approach**:
- **Primary**: Together AI (Mistral-7B) for speed and cost-efficiency
- **Fallback**: OpenAI GPT-4 for complex requests

**Generation Logic**:
```python
# Comprehensive prompt engineering
prompt = f"""
Create a {days}-day itinerary for {city} based on:
- Music taste: {music}
- Movie preferences: {movie}  
- Food preferences: {food}
- Weather: {weather_data}
- Recommended venues: {venues}

Return JSON with sections: itinerary, packing, tips, budget, transport, safety, closing
"""
```

**Sections Generated**:
- **Itinerary**: Day-by-day activities (morning/afternoon/evening)
- **Packing**: Categorized items (Clothing, Electronics, Documents, etc.)
- **Budget**: Daily cost estimates by category
- **Tips**: Local insights and recommendations
- **Transport**: Getting around options
- **Safety**: Important safety information
- **Closing**: Personalized farewell message

### 4. Data Enhancement & Enrichment

**Weather Integration**:
- Fetches 7-day forecast from OpenWeatherMap
- Influences packing recommendations and activity suggestions

**Visual Content**:
- **City Images**: Unsplash API for hero images
- **QR Codes**: Generated for each recommended place
- **Maps Integration**: Google Maps links for navigation

**Content Processing**:
```python
# Robust JSON parsing with multiple attempts
def robust_json_parse(val):
    tries = 0
    while isinstance(val, str) and tries < 3:
        try:
            val = json.loads(val)
        except Exception:
            break
        tries += 1
    return val
```

### 5. PDF Generation
**Module**: `routes.py` - `download_pdf()`

**Architecture**:
- **Library**: ReportLab for professional PDF creation
- **Layout**: Multi-page document with proper pagination
- **Styling**: Custom color scheme and typography

**PDF Structure**:
1. **Cover Page** (no page numbers)
   - Trip title and destination
   - User information and dates
   - Hero image
   - Qloo branding

2. **Content Pages** (with page breaks)
   - Destination overview with "Why This City?" reasoning
   - Cultural DNA table showing taste mappings
   - Weather forecast table
   - Taste summary
   - Categorized packing checklist
   - Budget estimates table
   - Flight cost estimates
   - Travel essentials (tips, transport, safety)
   - Recommended places with QR codes
   - Day-by-day itinerary with time periods
   - Final message and attribution

**Page Break Logic**:
```python
# Automatic page breaks when content exceeds available space
if y < minimum_space_needed:
    pdf.showPage()
    y = height - 40
```

**Text Processing**:
- **Cleaning**: Removes AI artifacts, markdown, and formatting issues
- **Wrapping**: Intelligent text wrapping for proper layout
- **Styling**: Consistent fonts, colors, and spacing

## üîß Key Processing Logic

### Taste Mapping Algorithm
1. **Input Analysis**: Extracts cultural preferences from user input
2. **API Integration**: Queries Qloo for taste-based recommendations
3. **Cultural Bridging**: Maps personal tastes to destination experiences
4. **Venue Matching**: Finds specific locations aligned with preferences

### Content Normalization
```python
# Handles various AI response formats
def normalize_json_section(section):
    if isinstance(section, str):
        parsed = try_parse_json(section)
        return parsed if isinstance(parsed, (dict, list)) else section
    return section
```

### Packing List Intelligence
- **Categorization**: Automatically sorts items into logical groups
- **Weather Integration**: Adjusts recommendations based on forecast
- **Cleaning**: Fixes common AI parsing errors (e.g., 'rncoat' ‚Üí 'raincoat')

### Error Handling & Fallbacks

- **Missing Data**: Sensible defaults and user-friendly messages
