## Sample User Prompts

- I'm really into romantic drama films like In the Mood for Love and Lost in Translation. I also enjoy mellow, nostalgic music — think 90s dream pop, lo-fi beats, and ambient jazz. I’m looking for a relaxing, artsy destination where I can explore indie cinemas, quiet cafés, and maybe catch a small jazz performance. Any suggestions on where to go next?

- I’m drawn to contemplative Japanese films like Shoplifters and Drive My Car, and I listen to lo-fi, ambient jazz, and instrumental piano music. I adore minimalist cafés, tranquil temples, and sushi or ramen spots. I’m looking for a quiet, soul-soothing destination — somewhere to slow down and reflect.

- I love energetic Latin music, especially reggaeton and salsa, and movies with strong emotional stories like Roma or Amores Perros. I’m also a big fan of street tacos, ceviche, and food markets. I want to explore somewhere colorful, musical, and full of authentic flavors.

- I'm into classic French cinema like Amélie and The 400 Blows, and I love chanson and vintage jazz. I’m obsessed with croissants, seafood platters, and cozy bistros. Looking for a city with romantic charm, great food, and lots of galleries and indie film houses.

- I enjoy laid-back beach vibes, reggae and acoustic music, and Southeast Asian street food—especially Thai noodles and fresh seafood. I’m not into big cities; I prefer islands, night markets, and wellness retreats. Recommend somewhere sunny and chill to unwind and eat well.

- I love gritty indie films, 90s grunge, and underground hip hop. Food-wise, I’m into burgers, food trucks, and local beer scenes. I’m looking for a raw, creative city with a strong music history and late-night culture.

- I’m inspired by classic Italian cinema like La Dolce Vita and love orchestral music and operatic vocals. I adore Mediterranean food — seafood pastas, espresso, gelato — and wandering through historic streets and piazzas. Suggest a culturally rich place to indulge and explore slowly.

- I’m into mystical, ambient world music and love films with desert or nomadic themes like The Sheltering Sky. I’m curious about North African flavors—tagine, mint tea, grilled meats. I’d love to visit somewhere earthy, spiritual, and sensory-rich.

- I watch K-dramas like Crash Landing on You, enjoy K-pop, and love Korean BBQ, street snacks, and bubble tea. I’m looking for a sleek, energetic city with fashion, nightlife, and cultural depth.

- I’m a huge fan of samba, bossa nova, and Afro-Brazilian beats, and I love films that capture movement and rhythm like City of God. I enjoy street food, caipirinhas, and coastal energy. Recommend a place that’s musical, alive, and full of expression.

- I'm obsessed with traditional samba and bossa nova, especially live street performances during Carnaval in Brazil. I watch films like Black Orpheus and City of God, and I live for the food—feijoada, caipirinhas, and grilled seafood. Suggest a destination that truly celebrates Afro-Brazilian culture in its streets, food, music, and rhythm.
